# EmbrAI Landing Page

This is a landing page for EmbrAI, a startup that enhances embryo selection in IVF by leveraging AI and federated learning to improve accuracy while ensuring patient data privacy.

## Project Overview

EmbrAI combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with clinical expertise to support embryologists in selecting embryos with the highest implantation potential. The AI model analyzes key morphological factors—such as cell number, symmetry, fragmentation, blastocyst expansion, inner cell mass (ICM), and trophectoderm quality—based on established grading systems like Gardner's.

By training on time-lapse imaging and clinical outcome data, the AI provides objective, data-driven embryo assessments to assist embryologists. Federated learning ensures clinics retain full control over patient data, training the model locally while sharing only anonymized updates, making it HIPAA/GDPR compliant.
